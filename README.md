# monterail_task

Javascript position recruitment task for Monterail made by Pawe≈Ç Kieryk.

### I used:

- Vue

- Vuex

- VeeValidate

- Vue CLI 3

- Moment.js

- SCSS

- BEM naming methodology

### Design

I've implemented the design that you delivered me. I've done my best to measure sizes, colours and fonts without design files - just from JPG's.

### Code

My approach was to divide the design into small pieces and build reusable components, so I can reuse them wherever I want in the future.

Custom inputs that I've built are elastic and have additional properties like helper-text and inputmode.

For validation, I've used VeeValidate library because I used it before and I feel comfortable using it.

To increase application performance I've used functional components where it was possible.

In SCSS, I've declared some variables and mixins to work faster.

I've also added some animations.

### What would I do next:

- Use Vue Router, but for now the app is too small to do this.

- Make custom datepicker and timepicker component.

- Make responsive version to look better.

### Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run serve

# build for production
npm run build
```
